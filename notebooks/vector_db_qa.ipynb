Many transgender women and providers alike report an anecdotal improved breast and/or areolar development, mood, or libido with the use of progestogens.[17,18] There is no evidence to suggest that using progestogens in the setting of transgender care are harmful. In reality some patients may respond favorably to progestogens while others may find negative effects on mood. While progestogens have some anti-androgen effect through central blockade of gonadotropins, there is also a theoretical risk of a direct androgenizing effect of progestogens. This class includes micronized bioidentical progesterone (Prometrium) as well as a number of synthetic progestins. The most commonly used synthetic progestin in the context of transgender care is the oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera).', metadata={'source': 'https://transcare.ucsf.edu/guidelines/feminizing-hormone-therapy'})]}"
