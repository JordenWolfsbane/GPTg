 'source_documents': [Document(page_content='Spironolactone is the most commonly used androgen blocker in the U.S. Spironolactone is a potassium sparing diuretic, which in higher doses also has direct anti-androgen receptor activity as well as a suppressive effect on testosterone synthesis.[6] Doses of 200mg daily in non-transgender women being treated for hair loss have been described as safe, though doses of up to 400mg/day have been reported without negative effect.[7] Hyperkalemia is the most serious risk but is very uncommon when precaution is taken to avoid use in individuals with renal insufficiency, and use with caution and frequent monitoring in those on ACE inhibitor or ARB type medications. Due to its diuretic effect, patients may experience self-limited polyuria, polydipsia, or orthostasis.', metadata={'source': 'https://transcare.ucsf.edu/guidelines/feminizing-hormone-therapy'}),
  Document(page_content="Ideally you should get U&E (urea and electrolytes) tested for (see if you're dehydrated, basically) if you\nare\non spiro.\n\nIf you are predisposed to developing hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels), you should also get your potassium levels\ntested regularly if you take spironolactone, as spiro can cause your body to retain more potassium.\n\nFor the vast majority of people though, this is not a relevant concern.\n\nCyproterone acetate:\n\nExtremely high doses of cyproterone, mostly found above 50mg/day and 100mg/day can cause a myriad of\ndifferent\nharsh side effects and risks, mainly prolactinomas and meningiomas (small benign brain tumors).\n\nAt dosages relevant to transfeminine people (6.25-12.5mg/day) the risk profile is much different. The same\nrisks\nare still present but much lower at smaller doses.\n\nCyproterone is also known to slightly increase blood clot risk, although the increase in risk is quite low\nat\ndosages used in trans people.", metadata={'source': 'https://diyhrt.wiki/transfem'}),

  Document(page_content='In addition to assessing the positive changes associated with sex steroid hormone therapy, the HCP should regularly assess whether the treat- ment has caused any adverse effects (see Appendix C—Table 2). Examples of adverse signs and symptoms include androgenic acne or bothersome sexual dysfunction (Braun et al., 2021; Kerckhof et al., 2019). GAHT also has the potential to adversely influence several laboratory tests. For example, spironolactone may cause hyperkalemia, although it is an uncommon and transient phe- nomenon (Millington et al., 2019). Testosterone increases the red blood cell count (hematocrit), which may occasionally cause erythrocytosis (Antun et al., 2020) (see Statement 12.17) (Hembree et al., 2017). Both estrogen and tes- tosterone can alter lipid parameters, such as high-density protein lipoprotein (HDL) choles- terol and triglycerides (Maraka et al., 2017).
